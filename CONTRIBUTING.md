# Contributing to pd-react-skeleton

`pd-react-skeleton` is the starting point for other front-end React applications.  Sometimes you may need to make a change to this starter skeleton.  Here a some guidelines for doing so:

## Testing your changes

This skeleton itself contains an example React app, so that you can test your changes in an  application in your development environment.  Just run `npm start`, and you'll be able to access the example application by visiting http://localhost:3000/.

See the [README](README.md) for more steps on developing and testing in this repo.

## Pull Requests

Once your changes are in place, open a Pull Request and add the Awaiting Review label.  FE-Core will provide a code review.  Reach out to the #fe-core Slack channel if you have any questions.

## Publishing

There is not any kind of versioning or publishing of `pd-react-skeleton`.  When your Pull Request is approved, and Circle CI is passing, simply merge your PR into master.  Anyone using the skeleton after this point will be copy/pasting or forking this repo, and your new changes will now be included.
